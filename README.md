# Machine Learning

A reading list for Machine Learning tutorials, books and tools

### Getting started

#### Wekinator 

Wekinator is a creative tool that allows you to train a model based on any incoming data. By manipulating sound and images, you will learn the basics of classification and regression algorithms.
- [Wekinator course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists-v) - The audit course is free

#### Udacity

- [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)

#### Science Kit Learn

Science Kit provides python libraries, readymade datasets and algorithms for testing, and a visualisation tool. Get started running python with this tutorial:
- [Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting)
