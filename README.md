## But what is a Neural Network?

# Javascript

Javascript is the language of the web, allowing easy deployment to an app or a website.

### K-Nearest-Neighbour

This is a very basic algorithm (similar to Pythagoras Theorem) where you use the distance between points to classify a new point. These two demos might help you understand the basics of training a model and classifying data, without needing a Neural Network or a complex library:

- [Using the 'k-nearest neighbour' algorithm to train a model](https://github.com/NathanEpstein/KNear)
- [Demo project using 'K-Nearest-Neighbour'](https://github.com/KokoDoko/webcam-detectotron)

### Perceptron

A perceptron is a Neural Network that has only one cell. You can code it entirely by hand without needing any framework or library, in only about 20 lines of code. This tutorial is very useful for understanding what a Neural Network is actually doing!

- [Result of the tutorial, built in ObservableHQ](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mpj/neural-network-from-scratch-part-1)

### Neural Networks

[BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) is a library that allows you to instantiate a Neural Network, train it and run a classification in just a few lines of code.

[TensorFlowJS](https://js.tensorflow.org) is the Javascript version of Google TensorFlow, and [ML5](https://ml5js.org) is a wrapper that makes TensorFlowJS a bit more accessible to beginners.

# Processing

Processing is used in the creative field for creating music and visuals. 

### Perceptron

Daniel Shiffman wrote a tutorial on [building a simple neural network from scratch in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk).

### Wekinator

Rebecca Fiebrink wrote a tool called [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/downloads/) for Processing, which will get you started with machine learning through a graphical user interface, without any programming. Wekinator can apply classification and regression algorithms to any input, such as the webcam or an arduino sensor.
